# George Seeger

I am an energetic full stack web developer. I started programming in python during my Physics degree at Durham University, I worked in QA for a year for a medium size fintech company, where I learned my passion was for writing code. From there, I went on to do a 12 week development course at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy). I then landed a job as a software engineer at Polylytics, a (very) small Oxford based software consultancy company making bespoke ERP products for our clients using C#/.Net and Azure.

I am a quick learner, during my role at Lombard Risk I taught myself VBA, automated web testing in Java (Selenium) and at Makers Academy I learned Ruby and Javascript. At Polylytics, I quickly learned C#, SQL and furthered my knowledge of design patterns, the front end stack, data warehousing and the principles of software engineering - writing clean, maintainable, extensible, tested code.

I genuinely enjoy programming, doing kata style programming challenges most days of the week, even on holiday!
