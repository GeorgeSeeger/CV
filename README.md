# George Seeger

I am an energetic junior full stack web developer. I started programming in python during my Physics degree at Durham University, I worked in QA for a year for a medium size fintech company and have finished a 12 week development course at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy) with an aim to move from QA to development.

I am a quick learner, during my role at Lombard Risk I taught myself VBA, automated web testing in Java (Selenium) and at Makers Academy I learned Ruby and Javascript. As a side project during my time at Makers Academy, I have taken on learning Common LISP as an exercise, and to see if the 'hype' surrounding the language/paradigm is true.
